## 1. Introduction

#### This project demonstrates how to simulate, control, and plan motions for the **Universal Robot 5 (UR5)** robotic arm using **ROS 1 Melodic**, **Gazebo**, and **MoveIt!**. You'll learn how to launch UR5 in simulation, set up path planning pipelines, and experiment with hardware-like control.

## 2. What is the UR5 Simulation Project?

The **UR5 Simulation** is an educational robotics platform designed to teach:

- **ROS-based robot arm control**  
- **MoveIt motion planning pipelines**  
- **Gazebo simulation with URDF & meshes**  
- **Trajectory execution and visualization in RViz**

Unlike mobile robots, robotic arms require **inverse kinematics (IK)**, **path planning**, and **gripper/tool integration**. This project provides a structured way to explore those concepts with the UR5 model.

Think of this as your **training ground for industrial robotics**. Instead of dealing with expensive hardware, you get the same software architecture in a safe simulated environment.
